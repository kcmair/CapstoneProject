    static let helpViewText = "Biker Maps is an app that is designed to allow you and other users to share their favorite rides with each other. To create a new route tap on the \"CREATE NEW ROUTE\" button. This will take you to a map screen of North America. Using pinch gestures on your device screen, zoom in to the starting location of your favorite route. PLEASE DO NOT USE YOUR HOME AS THE STARTING OR ENDING LOCATION. Align the pin in the center of the screen to the starting location and tap the select button in the bottom right corner. Then zoom out and back in to the ending location of the route. Again center the pin on this location and tap select. You will then need to select a midpoint location to ensure that the mapping software maps the route you are trying to create rather than just mapping the shortest route between the start and end points. Once again align the pin in the center of the map with the midpoint and tap select. The app will now draw the map for you. Inspect the rendered route to make sure it is the route you want. If it is not the correct route tap the back button in the top left and then tap CREATE NEW ROUTE again. If it is the correct route tap next which will take you to the details screen where you will be required to give the route a name, select the best type of cycle, and rate the route according to its scenery, road/trail conditions, and overall rating. You will not be able to save the route until all of these requirements are met. You will also have the option to include some notes. When you are finished, tap the save button in the top right corner of the screen. This will take you back to the launch screen where you will have the option to create another route or view previously created routes including the one you just made.\n\nTo view routes that you and others have created, tap the \"EXISTING ROUTES\" button. This will take you to a screen showing the existing routes on the server along with their starting and ending cities. To view the details of each route just tap on its row. You will then be taken to a screen showing the route map along with the overall distance and ratings. Find one that you like and then go check it out."
